* Track minimal and maximal (inclusive) costs and somehow print them.
    There's a problem with tracking inclusive costs after merging subtrees.
    If we truly merge the subtrees, there is no way to recalculate minimal and/or
    maximal inclusive costs after a new child was added to this tree because we don't know what
    to do with it.
    Possible Solutions:
        - Just add the child's inclusive costs to direct and indirect parent's min and
            max inclusive costs.
            This might not be true, so it's not really an option.
        - When merging siblings, keep data about the subtrees.
            This might complicate all tree operations a lot.
        - Forbid adding children after compression.
            This could be done by giving the CallTree a 'finalize' method, which compresses
            and finalizes the nodes.
* Write meaningful Rating classes and modify the rating->color transformation method so it
    makes sense.
* Move CLI UI away from entry point.
* Move test data out of the way, ideally use it as an example.
