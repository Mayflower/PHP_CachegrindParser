Priority

Must
------------
* External documentation
* Unit test
* Remove filtering from  Parser and Formatters and write the corresponding filter plugins
* Write meaningful Rating classes and modify the rating->color transformation method so it makes sense.
* Move CLI UI away from entry point.
* Move test data out of the way, ideally use it as an example.

Later/Maybe
-----------
* Add and document API interface
